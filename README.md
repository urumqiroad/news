A deadly fire killed at least 10 people in Urumqi (Wulumuqi), Xinjiang, a city that was in months-long Covid lockdown, in China’s far western region.


A video footage showed lockdown measures delaying firefighters from accessing the scene and reaching victims. The Chinese government not only blamed it on the residents’ lack of ability of self help but also censored related information.

People went on the street to protest against the Zero-Covid Policy and to call for democracy in several major cities. 
Many of them were arrested by the police.

They chanted, “Xi Jinping, step down!” and “Communist Party, step down!”.

We, the people of China, want to spread this message that speaks our minds in places without censorship.
